## installation

first get haskell-stack
```https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install```

then just run
```stack install```

and make sure ~/.local/bin is in your path

depending on your os, you might need to go get `/usr/share/dict/words` (installed by default on macs and most \*nixs)

on arch: `sudo pacman -Su words`
